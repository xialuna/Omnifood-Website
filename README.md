A redesign of a landing page website as my final project for a Udemy course about building a responsive  real-world website. In this project, I revamped and built a website for Omnifood, a fictional company that offers AI-based food subscription service. I used figma to create a hi-fi prototype for the website and mobile app, and translated the design using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. <br/>

## Concepts Used
- Utilized Figma to create a high-fidelity prototype for both the website and mobile app.
- Implemented `flexbox`, `grid` layouts, and `absolute position` to structure the website.
- Incorporated `media queries` for the website's responsiveness.
- Add scrolling and hover animations using `@keyframes` and `transition`.
- Used `Intersection Observer` to trigger specific actions as elements came into view during scrolling.
- Implemented `scrollIntoView` for smooth scrolling
- Leveraging JavaScript, I constructed interactive `carousels` and `toggles`
- Deployed website and made the forms functional
